# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

## Introduction  
The Road Accident Analysis Dashboard is an interactive Power BI project designed to analyze and visualize accident trends across different parameters such as vehicle type, road type, light conditions, and urban-rural distribution. The dashboard converts raw data into meaningful insights to help identify key causes of road incidents and support data-driven decisions for improving road safety.

## Purpose  
The purpose of this project is to provide a clear analytical view of road accidents and highlight areas that require attention. It demonstrates how business intelligence tools can be used to extract insights from real-world data and present them through an interactive, easy-to-understand interface.

## Tech Stack  
**Technologies Used:**  
- Microsoft Power BI – for data modeling and visualization  
- Microsoft Excel / CSV – as the primary data source  
- Power Query Editor – for data transformation and cleaning  
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – for creating custom measures and calculations  

**How it Works:**  
Data is imported and cleaned using Power Query, modeled into relational structures, and visualized using Power BI charts, maps, and KPIs. DAX is used to calculate year-over-year changes, totals, and other performance indicators.

## Data Source  
The dataset is based on road accident records that include details such as accident severity, vehicle type, lighting conditions, and location type (urban/rural).  
For this project, data was taken from publicly available sources such as UK Road Safety Open Data or Kaggle datasets. Users can replace or extend the dataset with their own files for further testing or analysis.

## Features and Highlights  
- Dynamic KPIs for total casualties, serious injuries, and fatalities  
- Year-over-year comparison between current and previous years  
- Breakdown by vehicle type, road type, and light conditions  
- Urban and rural area analysis  
- Geographic map visualization for casualty locations  
- Filters for road surface and weather conditions  

## Goal of the Dashboard  
The goal is to provide an overall understanding of road safety trends and help identify:  
- High-risk road types and conditions  
- Accident-prone vehicle categories  
- Urban vs. rural risk distribution  
- Potential areas for infrastructure and policy improvements  

## Key Visuals Overview  
- **KPI Cards:** Show total casualties and percentage change from previous year  
- **Vehicle Type Breakdown:** Displays casualty count by type (car, bike, bus, etc.)  
- **Yearly Trend Comparison:** Monthly comparison between current and previous years  
- **Urban vs. Rural Split:** Visualizes accident distribution across regions  
- **Light Condition Chart:** Shows day vs. night accidents  
- **Road Type Analysis:** Highlights which types of roads contribute most to accidents  
- **Map Visualization:** Plots casualty density on the map for geographic insights  

## Business Insights  
The analysis reveals that:  
- Single carriageways account for a majority of casualties  
- Urban areas contribute more than 60% of total accidents  
- Cars and bikes are the most frequently involved vehicles  
- Most accidents occur in light conditions, but night-time ones tend to be more severe  

These insights can help government bodies, road authorities, and transport departments design more effective safety campaigns, allocate resources efficiently, and implement preventive measures.

## Example Business Application  
A transportation authority can use the dashboard to identify high-risk zones, improve street lighting in dark areas, or plan awareness programs targeting high-incident vehicle types. It can also support data-backed decision-making for infrastructure planning and safety policy development.
